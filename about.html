			<p class="intro">
			    A wholly indigenous company, TECON was originally an Isle of Man company controlled by an 
			    American Investor group through Alliance Oil of Houston, Texas. TECON became a 100% Nigerian 
			    Company through acquisition in 1991, whilst still retaining its Isle of Man identity.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Our objective is to create and increase value providing competitive returns to our investors. 
			    Tecon is a &ldquo;star&rdquo; in the business of Oilfield Equipment Rentals and Provision of such 
			    specialized services as Oil Well Fishing, Casing and Tubing Running, Oil Well Snubbing/Hydraulic 
			    Workover Services, Machine shop/Tool fabrication and Redressing e.t.c.
			</p>
			<p>
			    At Tecon, safety is not only a watchword, it is a habit. Meeting safety standards in all areas 
			    of operation is a commitment that is never compromised. Our equipment and tools are sourced from the 
			    world&rsquo;s best manufacturers.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Tecon seeks to be a lasting medium-sized company (with average annual billing, in excess of 
			    USD 50 million by 2007 and Technical staff / Consultants strength of under 300), a 
			    professionally managed organization providing high local value-added, quality and efficient services 
			    to leading E&amp;P and services companies in the Nigerian Oil &amp; Gas Sector, and potentially, in 
			    the West/Central African Offshore Markets â€“ Equatorial Guinea, Sao Tome &amp; Principle, Angola, 
			    Cameroon etc.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The staff of Tecon are driven by excellence and fully committed to satisfying the needs of our 
			    Clients through quality service delivery. Our inspiration is in our determination to redefine 
			    the standard of service delivery through the stock of the state of the art equipment, tools, and 
			    techniques that we deploy for operation. Our aim is to broaden and deepen indigenous service 
			    capabilities and portfolios in oilfield/well engineering service provision. And our goal is to 
			    become the foremost indigenous oilfield service provider in the years ahead.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Through re-engineering, strategic repositioning, corporate venturing, technical and marketing 
			    alliances, Tecon is focused on establishing, maintaining and growing leading or tier market 
			    positions in some key areas of well engineering &mdash; drilling, completions, work over, well 
			    services and related maintenance and logistical / support services, and with emphasis on asset-based 
			    technical and rentable equipment, tools and units.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Tecon plans to become through strategic corporate re-engineering, Equipment acquisition, innovative 
			    technology applications and strategic skill acquisition investments, the company providing unequalled 
			    and unparalled Equipment Rental and Services to the major players in the Upstream sector of the 
			    Nigerian Oil and Gas theatre and the regional offshore markets.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In the dynamic Nigerian Oilfield/Well Engineering environment, Tecon seeks to offer the maximum 
			    benefit that is achievable from any field development project by bringing together the powerful 
			    combination of leading edge Equipment/Tools, technical expertise and high performance standard / track 
			    record.
